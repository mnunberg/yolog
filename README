This is a simple logging module, in the spirit of my perl module which does
a similar thing (actually, my perl module was inspired by this).

This module is quite simple, but handy if you would like to debug in the
terminal with colors. It also avoids having to use '\n', and automatically
places the line number and a file-global 'module-name'.

To use:
/*Include the yolog.h header file*/
#include "yolog.h>
/*Then initialize file-local parameters. This *MUST* be done*/
YOLOG_STATIC_INIT("MyModule", YOLOG_INFO);
/*Then use in code*/
void do_something(void) {
	yolog_debug("This won't show");
	yolog_info("Hello World");
}
/*When calling do_something(), the following should print to the screen:*/
[MyModule] do_something:6 Hello World
